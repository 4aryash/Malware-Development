# Malware-Development
The main aim of this project was to create an executable file in a different extension format(.jpg/.pdf/.mp4/..), which is to be planted on a Target Windows machine. <br>When the user of the target machine clicks on the planted file(even by mistake), a connection will be established on the Hacker's machine which will provide a running Shell of the target machine and give its entire access.<br> Apart from the user's priveleges, a Keylogger file can be executed from the Hacker's machine anytime, to capture any and all the keystrokes from the target machine's keyboard.

## Goals
>• Create connection with Server.<br>
>• Create a shell function to listen for the incoming commands from server and provide options.<br>
>• Start/Spawn other programs to execute any other .exe files.<br>
>• Playing with files & directories.<br>
>• Implementing Keylogger to our backdoor.<br>
>• Automatically start program when machine is Rebooted (Add-on).<br>

## Usage
>• Download the **malware.c** and **server.c** files.<br>
>• Change the IP address to your corresponding IP address in the **malware.c** and **server.c** files. The default port used is **42069**.<br>
>• Use the command ***gcc server.c -o run-server*** to compile the code. This will create an executable named **run-server**.<br>
>• Use the command ***i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o malware.exe malware.c -lwsock32 -lwininet*** to create a file named **malware.exe**.<br>
>• Copy the **malware.exe** file onto a windows 7,10 operating system.<br>
>• Run the **run-server** file using the command ***./run-server*** on a Linux Terminal.<br>
>• After the server file is running, click on the **malware.exe** file on Windows and you will get a Shell on your Linux Terminal successfully.<br>
