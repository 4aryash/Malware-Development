# Malware-Development-using-Socket-Programming-in-C
The main aim of this project is to create an executable file in a different extension format(.jpg/.pdf/.mp4/..), which is to be planted on a Target Windows machine. When the user of the target machine clicks on the planted file(even by mistake), a connection will be established on the Hacker's machine which will provide a running Shell of the target machine and give its entire access. Apart from the user's priveleges, a Keylogger file can be executed from the Hacker's machine anytime, to capture any and all the keystrokes from the target machine's keyboard.
