# Malware-Development-using-Socket-Programming
The main aim of this project is to create an executable file in a different extension format(.jpg/.pdf/.mp4/..), which is to be planted on a Target Windows machine. When the user of the target machine clicks on the planted file(even by mistake), a connection will be established on the Hacker's machine which will provide a running Shell of the target machine and give its entire access. Apart from the user's priveleges, a Keylogger file can be executed from the Hacker's machine anytime, to capture any and all the keystrokes from the target machine's keyboard.

# Goals
1 Create connection with Server.<br>
2 Create a shell function to listen for the incoming commands from server and provide options.<br>
3 Start/Spawn other programs to execute any other .exe files.<br>
4 Navigating through different directories.<br>
5 Implementing Keylogger to our backdoor.
6 Automatically start program when machine is Rebooted (Add-on).<br>

# Usage
1 Download the 'backdoor.c' and 'server.c' files.<br>
2 Change the IP address to your corresponding IP address in the 'backdoor.c' and 'server.c' files.<br>
3 Use the command 'gcc server.c -o run-server' to compile the code. This will create the 'run-server' file.<br>
4 Use the command 'i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o malware.exe backdoor.c -lwsock32 -lwininet' to create the 'malware.exe' file.<br>
5 Copy the 'malware.exe' file onto a windows 7,10 operating system.<br>
6 Run the 'run-server' file using the command './run-server' on a Linux Terminal.<br>
7 After the server file is running, click on the 'malware.exe' file on Windows and you will get a Windows Shell successfully.<br>
