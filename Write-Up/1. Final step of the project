This file is to be read in the beginning(for understanding) and at the end of the project(for execution).

Requirements: An executable file(.exe)
              Windows Environment

>> Open browser and search JPG to ICO convertor
>> Select the image file from the computer and set the icon format to 64*64
>> Convert the file to Icon file and save it.

>> Now we have an image file, an icon file and an executable file.
>> Select the image and exe file, right click and "Add to archive."
>> Set the Archive name to "clickMe.jpg"
>> Check the "Create SFX archive" so that our file has a .exe extension to run, and the filename changes to "clickMe.jpg.exe"
>> Go to Advanced options and we must now set the options one by one.
>> In the setup tab, we must assign the programs that we want to run, after the file extraction. Mention the names line by line.
>> Here, we enter the "imageFileName.jpg" in the first line and then the "executableFileName.exe" in the second line.
>> Next, we go to the Modes option and Check the "Unpack the temporary folder" and select the "Hide all" button.
>> Now, go to the Text and icon option and then "Load the SFX icon from the file".
>> Select the Icon File that we created.
>> Now, go to the Update option tab and select the "extract and update files" and "overwrite all files" buttons.
>> Click on Ok and wait for the Malware file to be processed.

As soon as we click on the Malware file, the image file opens and the program starts to do its job simultaneously.
