Commands to test the Malware File,
 
 1. Change the IP address to your corresponding IP address in the "malware.c" and "server.c" files.
 
 2. Use the command "gcc server.c -o run-server" to compile the code. This will create the "run-server" file.
 
 3. Use the command "i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o malware.exe malware.c -lwsock32 -lwininet" to create the "malware.exe" file.
 
 4. Copy the "malware.exe" file onto a windows 7,10 operating system.
 
 5. Run the "run-server" file using the command "./run-server" on a Linux Terminal.
 
 6. After the server file is running, click on the "malware.exe" file on Windows and you will get a Windows Shell successfully.

Thank you :)
